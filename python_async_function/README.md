# Python Async Project

This project is part of the ALU Web Backend curriculum and focuses on asynchronous programming in Python.

## What I Learned

* How to use `async` and `await`
* Running asynchronous programs with `asyncio`
* Creating and running concurrent coroutines and tasks
* Measuring execution time with the `time` module
* Using the `random` module in async functions

## Files

| File                         | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-basic_async_syntax.py`    | Waits a random time and returns it                   |
| `1-concurrent_coroutines.py` | Runs multiple coroutines and returns delays in order |
| `2-measure_runtime.py`       | Measures average runtime of `wait_n`                 |
| `3-tasks.py`                 | Creates an `asyncio.Task`                            |
| `4-tasks.py`                 | Runs multiple async tasks using task function        |

## Requirements Met

* Used Python 3.7 and `asyncio`
* Followed `pycodestyle` (v2.5.x)
* Used type hints and proper documentation
* Made all files executable and well structured

## ðŸ”— Resources Used
