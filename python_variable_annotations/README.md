# Python Variable Annotations

## Description

I have completed a series of tasks to practice using type annotations in Python 3. These tasks helped me understand how to add type hints to functions and variables, and how to work with more complex types like lists, tuples, unions, and callables. I also used `mypy` to check my code for type correctness.

## What I Did

* I wrote a function to add two floats with proper type hints.
* I created a function that joins two strings and annotated the types.
* I made a function that returns the floor of a float as an integer.
* I built a function to convert a float to a string with annotations.
* I defined variables with annotations for int, float, bool, and string.
* I wrote a function that sums a list of floats and returns a float.
* I created a function that sums a list of ints and floats using type unions.
* I made a function that returns a tuple with a string and the square of a number.
* I built a function that returns another function to multiply floats.
* I annotated a function that returns the length of elements in a list using duck typing.
* I updated a function to safely return the first element of a sequence using duck typing.
* I added type annotations to a function that safely gets values from a dictionary.
* I used `mypy` to type-check a function that zooms in on array elements and fixed any issues.

## What I Learned

* How to use type hints in Python
* How to work with basic and complex types
* How to use duck typing
* How to validate types using `mypy`
