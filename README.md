Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing your understanding of type annotations in Python 3, including their application in specifying function signatures and variable types. You will also explore duck typing, and learn how to validate your code using the mypy tool.

Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain type annotations in Python 3 without external references.
Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types effectively.
Understand and apply the concept of duck typing in Python.
Validate your Python code with mypy to ensure type correctness.
Requirements
All code must be written in Python 3 (version 3.7).
Files should begin with the shebang line: #!/usr/bin/env python3.
Each file must end with a new line.
Follow the pycodestyle style guide (version 2.5).
Ensure all files are executable.
The project must include documentation for all modules, classes, and functions.
Documentation Standards
Each module should have a clear and concise docstring.
Each class must include a docstring explaining its purpose.
Each function, whether inside a class or standalone, should have a docstring detailing its functionality.
To verify documentation, use the following commands:

bash

Copy
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
File Length
The length of your Python files will be tested using the wc command to ensure compliance with project standards.

Conclusion
This project is designed to deepen your understanding of Python's typing system and improve code quality through proper documentation and validation methods.
